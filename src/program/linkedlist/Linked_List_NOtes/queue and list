what is Queue?
Ans.  A queue is an ordered collection of items from which items may be deleted at one end(called the front of queue)
      and from which items may be inserted at the other end (called the rear of the queue).
Properties:
1.The first element inserted into a queue is the first element to be removed.
  For this reason a queue is sometimes called a fifo(First-in,First-out)list as opposed to stack.
Primitive Operations:-
1. insert(q,x) | insert item x at the rear of the queue.
2. x=remove(q) | delete the front element from the queue and set x to its contents.
3. empty(q)   | return true or fales depending on wheather or not queue contains any elements. 
     
Undreflow condition= The result of an illegal attempt to remove an element from an empty queue is called underflow.

Definition:(Tenen Baum): A stack is a ordered collection of items into which new items can be 
                         inserted and and deleted from one end called the "Top" of the stack.
                         also known as Last In First Out data Structure(LIFO) means the item
                         which is inserted at the end can be get first.
            two operations performed on the stack.
           1.PUSH(x) 2.POP()
Applications:
   1.used in expression evaluation(reverse polish notation)
   2.In Parsing Phase of Compilation.
   3.Recursion technique is implemented by the Stack.
