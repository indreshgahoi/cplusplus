
DEFINITION:A queue is an ordered collection of items from which items may be deleted at one end
           (called the "front") and inserted at other end (called the "rear") of the queue.
           also known as the First In First OUT (fifo) 
           Two operations can be performed on queues:
           1. ENQUEE 2.DEQUEE
Types :1.Priority queue.
       2.Double Ended Queue.
       3. Circular queue.

Application :1. priority queue is used in fifo Scheduling algorithms.
             2. queues are used in many graphs algorithms like BFS(breadth First Search)
