                         inserted and and deleted from one end called the "Top" of the stack.
                         also known as Last In First Out data Structure(LIFO) means the item

           1.PUSH(x) 2.POP()
Applications:
   1.used in expression evaluation(reverse polish notation)
   2.In Parsing Phase of Compilation.
   3.Recursion technique is implemented by the Stack.
