 An array is a finite ordered set of homogeneous elements,by finite means that
 the array has specific number of elements.,by homogeneous  means that the
 elements of an array are always have the same data type means there can be
 character array seperate and integer 
array as seperate but both combindely not possible in the arrays.

In mathematical form they can be viewed as a matrix.

Kinds :1.one dimensional arrays.2.multi dimensional arrays.

Merits :1.we can directly access any elment 
 if we want 4th elemnt in array so just needed a[3].O(1) random access.
        
      
Demerits :It is very costly to dlete any element from the array because shifting takes  place
          so the O(n) complexity of deletio

Application:Used to implements other data structures like:
            1. Binary heap
            2.Stack
            3.Queue
            4. HashTable.
            5.Dequee
