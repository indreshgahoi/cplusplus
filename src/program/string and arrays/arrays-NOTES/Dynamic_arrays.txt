
Definition:(wikipedia):In computer science, a dynamic array, growable array, resizable array,
      dynamic table, or array list is a random access, variable-size list data structure that allows 
      elements to be added or removed. It is supplied with standard libraries in many modern mainstream
      programming languages.
      A dynamic array is not the same thing as a dynamically-allocated array, which is a fixed-size
      array whose size is fixed when the array is allocated, although a dynamic array may use such 
      a fixed-size array as a back end.[1]

example: language such as java supports the dynamic arrays in <ARRAYLIST>
         In C++ .
