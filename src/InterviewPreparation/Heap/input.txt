 GURGAON: The Centre on Tuesday said it had alerted the Bihar government about possible terror attack on BJP Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi's rally in Patna which was rocked by serial blasts on Sunday.

"We have said that we had given input (about Patna rally). Now, it was general or specific input that is a different thing. Whenever there is specific input we give but whenever there are such rallies we give input saying you have rally in your state so there could be a possibility of an attack," he told reporters. He was replying to a question whether the Central government had alerted the Bihar government beforehand about possible terror attack on Modi's rally. Multiple blasts rocked in and around the rally venue in Patna on Sunday claiming six lives and injuring more than 80 people. "We give input saying you could be attacked in 2-3 days or so and so day. We keep doing that. We also give specific input," he said on the sidelines of a function organized on the occasion of the 74th raising day of CRPF.
